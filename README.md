# My-first-SQL-queries.
Use SQL (SQLite environment) to extract some columns of data form a music store database.
### After finishing a course of SQL for data analysis at Udacity, I used what I learnt to make some queries to select and join some data from the Database of `chinook db` ,a Digital Music Store Database, to perform some analysis.
> **In this project:**
- there is a text file with the queries I have done.
- a pdf of conclusions of the analysis of queried data.
- the Database of `chinook db`.
